Hospitals often face challenges in managing the influx of patients in their emergency departments. Triage, the process of assessing and prioritizing patients based on the severity of their conditions, is crucial but can be time-consuming and error-prone when done manually. This project addresses this problem by developing a digital triage system that automates the prioritization process, reducing delays and improving patient outcomes.
The objective of the Hospital Triage System project is to design and implement a computerized system to efficiently manage and prioritize patient treatment in a hospital's emergency department using a priority queue data structure in the C programming language. The system aims to streamline the triage process, ensuring that patients with the most critical conditions receive prompt medical attention, while also optimizing resource allocation.
~Priority Order followed:~ 

Immediate (Red) : Patients in critical condition who require immediate attention and potentially life-saving interventions. 
Urgent (Orange) Patients with serious but not immediately life-threatening conditions. 
Delayed (Yellow) Patients with non-urgent conditions that do not require immediate attention.
Minimal (Green) Patiente with minor injuries or illnesses that can typically wait longer for treatment. Expectant (Black) ; Patients whose injuries or conditions are so severe that survival is unlikely.
The core of the project is the implementation of the priority queue, where patients are inserted, removed, and updated based on their triage priority. This ensures that the most critical cases are always at the front of the queue and receive immediate attention. The project also involves creating user interfaces for patient registration, updating patient information, and generating reports.

In conclusion, the Hospital Triage System project based on a priority queue in C aims to enhance the efficiency of emergency department operations by automating and optimizing the patient triage process, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
